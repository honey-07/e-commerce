Some laws teach the need for prudence (\"Law 1 : Never Outshine the Master\"), the virtue of stealth (\"Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions\"), and many demand the total absence of mercy (\"Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally\"), but like it or not, all have applications in real life. Illustrated through the tactics of Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, P. T. Barnum, and other famous figures who have wielded--or been victimized by--power, these laws will fascinate any reader interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control.\n\nAlso look out for Robert Greene's latest book, Mastery, and discover just what it takes to be great.\nCountry of Origin : India",

The Canterville Ghost is a delightful story written in a witty way by Oscar Wilde, first published in 1887. The story is about a rather brash American family that buys a haunted mansion called Canterville Chase in Victorian England. Then there begins the holy terror by the ghost of a dead nobleman. Not only this American family faces new experiences in this mansion, this strange ghost also faces some odd but very curious experiences with this family that he had never faced before in 300 years.\nCountry of Origin : India",
